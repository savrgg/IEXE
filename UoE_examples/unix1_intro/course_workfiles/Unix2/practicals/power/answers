Selecting football results ...

* all matches played by Hibernian
	grep Hibernian results

* all home matches played by Aberdeen
	grep '^Aberdeen' results

* all away matches played by Dunfermline
	grep 'Dunfermline$' results

* all home matches played by Hibernian against Kilmarnock (Hint: you can join 
two greps togther using a pipe).

	grep '^Hibernian.*Kilmarnock$' results
